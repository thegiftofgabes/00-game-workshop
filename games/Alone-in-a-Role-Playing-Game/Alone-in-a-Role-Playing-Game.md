# Alone in a Role Playing Game

Based on Alone Among the Stars, by Takuma Okada

Goal: setting scenes by drawing cards and rolling dice to provide sparks for solo or gmless modes of playing TTRPGs.

Procedure outline to create a scene:
- Roll 1d6;
- Draw that many cards, spreading them side by side, and face down;
- Flip a card and roll 1d6 on the Major or Minor arcana table;
- Interpret the result and add it to the scene;
- When you want to, or when you are stuck, add the next card to the scene;
- After the last card on the scene, when you feel you've completed it, start a new scene.

Minor Arcana
- 1 – 2: an individual or a group
- 3 – 4: this place and its features
- 5 – 6: something happens or happened

Major Arcana
- 1 – 2: a wild, mystical, or humane entity
- 3 – 4: an offer or opportunity
- 5 – 6: an event or sudden change
