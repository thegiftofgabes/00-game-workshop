The Hierophant is our reminder that foundations are important- none more so than when we are on a course of spiritual discovery. Foundations are essential, and we need the infrastructure given by formal doctrines before we can successfully set out on our own course of beliefs and resulting choices. But rather than blind belief, the Hierophant encourages you to lean on a wise mentor, and in some cases even encourages you to become the mentor if that is what resonants.

## 6. The Lovers

The Lovers is the card of belief and personal choice. It also represents conscious connections and forming relationships that go beyond the superficial. If you get The Lovers card in a tarot reading, it could call your attention to several things.

If this card shows up, it almost always directs our attention to the relationships in our lives, whether romantic or platonic. Sometimes, The Lovers card can imply that we are questioning whether or not a person is a soulmate.

The person in mind feels like a soulmate, and you are serious about this connection being a lifelong commitment. There is a strong connection, both sexual and spiritual.

The Lovers card is often associated with making choices that honour yourself and your spiritual progress.

Make decisions from a place of compassion, and rest easy knowing that the arrival of an upright The Lovers card is a good omen for the relationship or person you are thinking about.

Aside from relating to a relationship or another person, The Lovers card can also encourage us to get real about our own set of values and belief systems.

This is important along the journey to self-awareness. What is important to you? What are your values and beliefs? Get clear on these and you will find your path in life.

One of my personal favorites, The Strength card reminds us that we are strong, powerful, and can do anything we put our minds to. While The Chariot, the previous card, symbolizes outer strength, this Strength card symbolizes inner strength and the resolve within us all to get through anything.

You might need to draw on stamina and keep forging ahead. The Strength card is here to remind you that you can triumph over any obstacle. But through this process, remember to remain calm and to act with compassion.

When you get The Strength card in a tarot reading, it often points to your inner strength and courage. But it also tells you to get ahead simply by staying true to your raw and honest self. Stay humble, but be brave.

The Hermit tarot card signifies that you are checking out from society and everyday life, and checking in to the inner hotel. Your energy needs a break. If you’re feeling drained and uninspired, it’s time to replenish those inner resources.

If you’re seeking answers and feel exhausted by looking, then have you tried looking within? As cliche as it sounds, The Hermit card tells us that we will find our answers by taking a look within ourselves.

Are you letting outside factors influence you too much? Where is your mind? Are you focused on replenishing your own energy? The Hermit card is not a common favorite, but it is one of mine. It has a quiet power, a card that reminds us that it’s okay to be a recluse sometimes, especially if we are feeling drained and in need of answers.

When you draw The Hermit card, you are most likely on the precipice of a new part of your self-discovery journey. This part will involve more introspection and time alone. Maybe you need to take a weekend off from work and all social obligations.

Tune out the outside world for a bit and tune into yourself. It’s time to meditate on your self-beliefs, motivations, and the things that propel you to be your truest self.
