in my mind + - (and but) increases the answer and adds a minor twist to it
yes, you open the lid, and there is enough ice cream for everyone, but it's a flavour no one likes
hahahaha
no, the ice cream pot doesn't have ice cream, worse, it has beans, but they seem tasty after you unfreeze them
as for - +
yes, there's ice cream, but the noise made your little sibling notice what you are up to, and they're gonna cry mom if you don't share
no, there's no ice cream in the fridge, but you notice there's a 50% off coupon under a magnet on the door of the fridge, and you know you just need another buck or two to have enough for another full pot of ice cream
