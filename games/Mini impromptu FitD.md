Mini impromptu FitD

Actions:
do
say
think
feel

distribute 6 points

when you make an action ask the GM what is the risk and the reward (my simplified version of the position and effect) 

risk: high (---) , medium (--) , low(-) , and no. The higher the risk, the greater the shortcoming of your roll

reward: high(+++) , medium(++) , and low(+) no. The greater the reward, the better result you get. 

Roll the dice
On a hit, you get ++
on a twist, you you get +-
on a miss, you get - - 

Each pair of + and - cancels out

for every + choose a boon
for every - choose a doom

[list of boons and dooms here] 

Stress: when stress is 10, you are out of commission

Resist: when yo want to call BS on the result of an action, roll 2d6. On a hit, add 1 stress, then on a twist, add 2 stress, on a miss add 3 stress. Tell the table what consequence you manage to avoid and how, you can if by luck, fate, preparation or something else.

Devil's bargain: discuss with the table what woul you give, and lose, or otherwise what looming complication is out in the horizon. You can make it true and get a +. 
for simplicity sake, imma take the list of good and bad results from a game called Fling for the boons and dooms
take a Doom for every remaining -:
1. Confront a fear- take [-1] on the next roll
2. Caught by a past mistake - cease a Connection
3. Misuse - Break an important thing
4. Damage - Gain 1 Stress
5. It got worse - Tick a challenge clock up
6. Underestimate - Tick a challenge clock up (again)

take a doom for every remaining +:
1. Anticipation - Describe the next moment or lose 1 Stress
2. Recognition - Create a new connection
3. Grit - take [+1] on the next roll
4. Deal -the challenge is on hold (for now)
5. Achievement- Tick a goal clock
6. Prestige action - Tick a goal clock (again)
