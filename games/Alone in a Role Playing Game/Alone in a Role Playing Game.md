# Creating a Scene

Based on Alone Among the Stars, by Takuma Okada

Goal: setting scenes by drawing cards and rolling dice to provide sparks for solo or gmless modes of playing TTRPGs.

Procedure outline:
- Roll 1d6;
- Draw that many cards, spreading them side by side, and face down;
- Flip a card and roll 1d6 on the Major or Minor arcana table;
- Interpret the result and add it to the scene;
- When you want to, or when you are stuck, add the next card to the scene;
- After the last card on the scene, when you feel you've completed it, start a new scene.
