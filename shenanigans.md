A Simple System for Challenge Resolution

Shenanigans is a simple system for creating characters and resolving challenges.

You will need:

- Dice - d4, d6, d8, d10, d20
- Paper or another medium for character creation

This system can be used for a variety of settings as it is centered on the character’s capabilities and approaches, rather than being setting-specific.

Pick two words to represent competencies, + Shenanigans. Or scratch Shenanigans for something else. Whatever words you choose as competencies will set the tone of the game.

Examples:

- Sword, Sorcery and Shenanigans
- Blasters, Dicers and Shenanigans
- Hack, Knit and Awesome

You might even consider creating a set of setting appropriate options for
characters to pick from or letting them pick whatever they want.

# Creating a Character

Characters have Competencies and Approaches. Competence is something they have trained, practised, learned and are skilled with, while an approach is how they direct their energy and knowledge to do it.

## Competences and Approaches

I will start with a fantasy setup. These are the three competencies:

- Moxie: your physical prowess, toughness, and resilience. Approaching tasks through moxie represents the use of brute force, strength, intimidation and persistence.
- Sorcery: your innate touch with magic and arcane knowledge.	Approaching tasks through sorcery represents the use of magic, tapping into the natural powers, charms or using arcane tricks.
- Shenanigans: your ability to solve problems and use tools and techniques. Approaching tasks through shenanigans represents the use of tools, workarounds, and slyness.

### Example Characters

**Moonlight, the Battle Priestess**
Moxie: 11

Sorcery: 13

Shenanigans: 9

grit: d8

grasp: d4

heart: d6

spirit: d6

wits: d4

**Mthunzi, the Lionblood Huntress** 

Moxie: 13

Sorcery: 9

Shenanigans: 11

grit: d6

grasp: d4

heart: d6

spirit: d4

wits: d8

### Competence Scores

The base competence score is 10.

- A competence you are good at gets +3.
- A competence you get away with gets a +1.
- A competence you suck at gets a -1.

Approaches
are how you undertake tasks using your competences. There are five
approaches. **Assign a die to each approach.** Your dice pool is:
d4, d4, d6, d6, d8.

- grit: your persistence, toughness, and drive. This is your direct	approach.
- grasp: your knowledge and cleverness. This is your smart approach.
- heart:	your connection with things that live and have a soul. This is your	kind approach.
- spirit: your will, charm and cunning. This is your sagacious	approach
- wits: your perception and insight of people and things. This is your	attentive approach.

#### Examples

Examples:
Moonlight would like to attempt to detect magic in this room. She decides that using her magic powers (sorcery) to open her awareness (wits) would be a fitting approach.
The GM determines this is an effective approach, so the difficulty is a d4 (3).
Moonlight adds her Wits to Sorcery: 13+1d4 (2) for a total of 15.
Moonlight must now roll a d20. Any result above 3 and up to 15 means a success.

Mthunzi feels uneasy and chooses to scout the area for an ambush. She decides to boast and gloat to bait enemies into giving themselves out (Moxie), while being ready to strike at the first sign of danger (Wits).
A group of assassins lead by a mage is in hiding, magically rendered invisible, so the DM determines that this approach is unfitting since Mthunzi is not magically equipped to detect the invisible, although baiting them out could work. So, the difficulty is a d8 (7).
Mthunzi adds her Wits to Shenanigans: 11+1d8 (3) for a total of 14.
Mthunzi must now roll a d20. Any result above 7 and up to 14 is a success.


# Resolving Tasks

Every
time a character tries to accomplish a task, they must describe how
they will approach it.

They
can combine any approach with any skill if they can narratively
justify that choice.

## Difficulty

The
GM will determine how effective that approach is and choose a
difficultly die accordingly.

The
difficulty dice are:

- d4 for an effective approach;
- d6 for a level approach;
- d8 for an unfitting approach;
- d10 for an ineffective approach.

### Roleplaying Competences and Approaches

Competences
represent what tools, abilities, and skills a character possesses for
overcoming challenges. In the example above, a fighter who attacks
with the Sorcery competence may represent the use of a 
magic
weapon, while a wizard trying to unlock a chest with sorcery
represents their using a spell.

## Attempts

To
make an attempt, the GM rolls the difficulty die. Then the player
rolls the competence die and a d20.

To
succeed, the character must obtain a result above the difficulty die
and equal or below the character skill + the competence die.

### Results

**Trying
too hard:** A failure above the skill + competence die roll
represents the character trying too hard. They fail and there is a
cost.

**Plain
success:** A success above the competence score and up to the
approach bonus is a plain success and the character manages to tackle
the task as appropriate.

**Success
with a catch:** A success above the difficulty and up to your
competence score is is a success with a cost.

**Falling
short:** A result equal or below the difficulty dice is represents
the character falling short. They fail and there is a cost. They can
use an action to make a break through and turn this failure into a
success with a catch.

### Cost Table

Roll
to determine a cost.

- An item breaks
- An item is lost;
- An action is wasted;
- Resilience is lost;
- Exhaustion is gained;
- The challenge difficulty dice is improved.

### Make a Break Through

When
falling short, a character may compromise their own effectiveness to
succeed at a task. This action represents a character pushing past
their own limits by temporarily sacrificing some of their own power.

- If they were good at the competence they used in this attempt, now	they can only get away with it.
- If they could get away with the competence they used in this	attempt, now they suck at it.
- If they sucked at the competence they used in this attempt, now they	are out of commission.

A
character can recover their competence one stage at a time per
respite round.

### Triumph and Fumble

A
d20 roll equal to the skill value is a triumph, and the outcome of
the attempt is above and beyond expected.

A
d20 roll equal to the difficulty roll is a fumble, and the
consequences of failure are dire beyond expected. Roll for a cost a
second time.

## Improving and reducing dice

Circumstances
and further character customisation can improve or reduce approach
and difficulty dice.

A
few possibilities are: implementing archetype systems, create or
allow character actions that manipulate dice (through inspiration,
blessings, curses and so on), token systems and more.

Dice
are improved or reduced as below:

d4
< d6 < d8 < d10

If
a dice would be improved or reduced twice, simply use a d10 or d4,
respectively. If a dice would be both improved and reduced, no matter
how many times each, cancel all changes and keep the original dice.

# Resolving Challenges

Challenges
take several attempts to be resolved. This is true for combat
challenges, exploration challenges, social challenges and travelling
challenges.

Every
successful attempt scratches a circle, top to bottom. A triumph
scratches two circles, but only if they are on the same line.

The
difficulty for each attempt depends on the challenge die, which
ranges from d4 to d10.

When
you scratch the first circle at the top, you are scratching the
surface. It means that the enemies got a few bruises, thet you got
the right pick for a lock or that you generally got the hang of a
task.

# Challenge Templates

**Easy
challenge** (picking a simple lock, defeating a bunch of minions,
searching for clear tracks in broad day light):

O

OO

**Medium
challenge** (overcoming a battle with a menacing opponent, climbing
a steep wall, bribing a guard):

O

OO

OOO

**Hard
challenge** (defeating a lieutenant, performing for a capricious
ruler, tearing down a picking a complex lock while the room is
flooding):

O

OO

OOO

OOOO

**Very hard challenge** (defeating an overlord’s general,
outsmarting a powerful, mystical being)

O

OO

OOO

OOOO

OOOOO

### Scratching the Surface and Getting to the Tricky
Part

When the company
scratches the top circle, they have **scratched the surface**.
When they scratch a circle at the bottom layer, they **got to the
tricky part**.

You may devise
mechanics and consequences to attacking each layer of a challenge,
much like a videogame boss gets harder when they’re health bar is
below 50% or like the last levels get trickier and require more
skills.
