# Weapon Prowess Die

This is an alternative to the D&D 5e weapon system.

Each class' base damage die per attack for medium weapons is equal to their hit die, minimum a d6, maximum a d10.

## **Base Prowess Die:**

Spellcasters (Sorcerer, Wizard): d6

Specialists (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, Warlock): d8

Warriors (Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger): d10

## **Weapon Size:**

Large weapons improve the damage die by a stage, maximum 2d6, and small weapons reduce the damage die by one stage, minimum 1d4.

# **Melee Weapons**

Small weapons can be wielded with one hand. They can be dual-wielded.

Medium weapons can be wielded one-handed but can only be dual-wielded with the Dual Wield feat.

Large weapons must be wielded with two hands.

## **Melee Weapon Types**

**Handles**

Handles are weapons like daggers and swords, clubs and Mace's, that you have to hold in one or two hands, and have a handle, so they are weighted to hit with the tip or length of the weapon.

**Polearms**

Polearms are long weapons held through their length. Usually, you attack using the tip of the weapon, which may be pointed, blunt, or bladed, like spears and quarterstaves.

**Wedges**

Wedges are weapons like axes, picks and maces, that have a longer handle but are weighted at one end.

**Flexible**

Flexible weapons include whips, chains and flails. They are composed of a handle and a flexible body such as a chain, leather, rope, metal blades and so on. Often there are one or more weights at the tip.

## **Ranged Weapons**

Ranged weapons are divided into two categories: one-handed and two-handed.

# **Weapon Properties**

A character can use as many weapon properties for a weapon as half their proficiency bonus rounded down. If a weapon they are wielding has more properties than they can use, they must pick which property they will keep until they can use more properties.

## **Customising weapons**

Instead of picking a weapon from the PHB, you may create your own. The rules are simple:

- Decide what your weapon looks like
- Choose a damage type
- Pick as many weapon properties as half of your proficiency bonus rounded down

Alternatively, you can pick a weapon listed from the PHB and customise it.

Customised weapons cannot be created with more properties than a character’s limit, but a smith or other type of weapon artificer can improve that weapon to add another property once a character is able to use more.

**Reach**

This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

**Thrown**

If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a Ranged Attack.

**Versatile**

This weapon can be used with one or two hands. If wielded with two hands, use a prowess die one category above.

**Silvered Weapons**

Some Monsters that have immunity or Resistance to nonmagical Weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coins to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of Ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.

## **Additional Weapon Properties**

These are homebrew weapon properties that need to be playtested. I’ll write fluff for them sometime.

**Defence**

At the beginning of your turn, as a bonus action, you may lower the damage die of this weapon by one stage, minimum 1d4. Add 1d4 to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.

**Fine**

This is a slightly superior quality weapon. Not quite magical, but better nonetheless.

1d4

1d4, re-roll 1

1d6

1d6, re-roll 1

1d8

2d4

1d6+1d4

2d6

3d4

**Concealed**

The looks of this weapon are unassuming. Choose sleight of hand or deception: checks with that skill are made with advantage to conceal it or pass it as something that doesn't seem harmful.

**Switchable**

This weapon has an additional damage type between slashing, bludgeoning and piercing. When attacking, pick which damage type you wish to use for each attack. You can pick this property twice.

**Grip**

This weapon has a grip device that makes it harder for others to disarm you. Attempts to disarm you are made at disadvantage.

**Shield breaker**

The shape and form of this weapon make it harder to block or defend against.

**Wrap**

This weapon can be used to wrap around inanimate objects within the attack range of the weapon, such as levers, columns, and similar structures with a successful attack roll.

A creature of a size no larger than your own can be hindered with a successful attack check, or inhibited with a successful attack check at a disadvantage. You deal no damage with this attack. The creature is bound to the range of this weapon (5 feet around you, or 10 feet around you if it has reach).

That creature can use an action, reaction or bonus action to break away with a successful acrobatics or athletics check against DC 10 + your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with this weapon.

You can let go of an object or creature you have wrapped with a bonus action. You may pull an object with a bonus action. You need a free hand to pick up something you pull towards yourself.

**Curved**

**Nock**

# **Origin Weapons**

An origin weapon is something tied to your character’s backstory. It doesn’t need to be a magical item - to the contrary, mundane weapons can be special or meaningful to you, to the point you are specially trained with that specific weapon.

Origin weapons gain properties as the character levels up and don’t require a weaponsmith or other type of artificer to improve it. Origin weapons will always have as many properties as half the character’s proficiency bonus rounded down +1.

Only the character whose origin weapon belongs to can wield it to its full capability. If a character loses their own origin weapon somehow, they cannot create another and must recover it to be able to take advantage of its benefits.

To create an origin weapon follow these steps:

- Give your weapon a Name
- Decide what your weapon looks like
- Choose a damage type
- Pick as many weapon properties as half of your proficiency bonus rounded down
- Pick an additional property

# **Feats**

## **Reach Weapon Master**

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:

When you take the Attack action and attack with a large weapon, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with another part of the weapon or the whiplash of the first attack; this attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4 and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.

While you are wielding a weapon with reach, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter your reach.

## **Great Weapon Master**

You've learned to put the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. You gain the following benefits:

On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

Before you make a melee attack with a large weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
