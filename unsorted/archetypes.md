# **Sample: Archetype**

## **Cultist**

**Common desires**

Acceptance, healing, community, converting, secrecy, resistance, power, control, guidance, protection

**Alignments**

**Faithful of the Dawn Godess**

**Desires**: healing, community, resistance, acceptance

Usually politheists, these cultists are the only ones whose faith is tolerated due to how much community work they provide as part of their main dogmas. The most dedicated Dawn Acolytes are indifferent to politics and humbly work on community kitchens, and other community support activities for free or nearly so.

**Goals:** Faithful of the Dawn Godess

- To provide aid to all, no questions asked
- To guide the people towards the end of poverty and suffering
- To shelter the marginalised and downthroden, regardless of their past
- To teach lessons in tolerance and acceptance
- To teach by action and example rather than through texts and church-going

**Ties:** Faithful of the Dawn Godess

In spite of the ban on other religions, the authorities justify this oversight by statements such as "The One has many aspects, and these are just some of the One's most benevolent forms." The White Stalker cultists are the most resentful of them on that account.

**Procedures (moves):** Faithful of the Dawn Godess

- Provide a warm meal to someone who's hurt or down.
- Provide shelter without asking questions.
- Scold someone for their selfish actions
