# Fail Forward and Memories

# Fail forward

Every time you make an ability check, you always succeed BUT, if you roll below the DC you choose to either get a drawback or fail, not the GM, you, the player, choose.

If you pick a failure, you get a memory point. You can hold as many as your proficiency bonus.

When you get a memory point, you assign it to the thing you failed at. You can spend a point you are holding to get a flat success next time you roll at that same thing.

When you fail at an attack roll, hold one for the next time you make an attack roll (of the same type, melee, ranged, magical). When you fail at a skill check, hold one for the next skill check (of the same proficiency or with the same tool), and so on.

# Memories of past lives

When you create your character write one "I Was statement" and one "I Remember" statement.

Your "I was" statement can be used to bypass a check related to that once in a while. It must be specific somewhat specific.

"I was a scribe who copied volumes about spirit families."

Your "I remember" is a thing you think you have done, also specific to a point. "I remember helping my mother run the forge."

Your "I remember" statement will allow you to get an advantage on checks related to that thing.

You get a drawback when you recall a memory like that.

You have as many memories as your proficiency bonus, and you can make any of these memories permanent at any time.

When you make a memory permanent, you don't get a drawback anymore when you recall that memory. You may also erase a memory and replace it with another, as you may realise that that memory was inaccurate, or inexistent.

When you are presented with a situation where you could recall a memory, you may choose to fail before making a check. Erase that memory from your character sheet.

When you make a check you would get a drawback you may choose to succeed without a drawback instead and not hold a memory point. Write a new memory related to that check or roll.
