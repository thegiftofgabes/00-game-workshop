You have a Giant Metal Body. If you run out of juice, you'll probably die, but you might just flee to die another day.

# 1. Creating a Giant Metal Body

Use whatever form of writing you have available to determine your Stats and Modules.

## Stats (highlight one)

- Cool - highlight: save 1 juice when you move to dodge or flee
- Edge - highlight: ignore a 1 when you attack
- Hope - highlight: you recover a tag on a 12
- Team - highlight: on a 12, +1d6 on your next roll

# Modules

Your giant metal body has 4 modules.

- Comms
- Weapons
- Shields
- Mobility

Choose 3 describing tags for each module.

Juice: Each module has 3 Juice at the start of every mission.

# 2. Procedures

This is how you play. The Demise Master will throw all sorts of disasters and destruction your way. Try to survive, or die trying.

## Dice

When you need to act in face of adversity, you get 1d6 from a stat, plus 1d6 from a module.

When you want to push it harder, spend juice and add 1d6 for each point you spent.

When you have a disadvantage, roll -1d6, or spend a tag to clear it

When a module runs out of juice, it stops completely, unless you patch 1 to 3 Juice from another module.

Roll as many d6 as you must, then keep the highest 2 and add them together. If you have only 1d6 to roll, roll 2d6 and double the lowest dice. If you have 0d6 to roll, you can't do that thing.

1-6: you fail and lose 1 juice

7-9 you do it but it's not great, or you can spend 1 juice to do it without a hitch

10-12 you do it without a hitch

## Some Actions:

Attack - use weapons to destroy a minor threat or to gain an advantage in battle

Get Support - use comms to receive support from your unit

Protect - use Shields to avoid a disadvantage or to protect an ally

Position - use mobility to dodge an attack or to move into a position of advantage

Change those as needed and come up with your own. I'm not your boss.

## Doing Battle

This is what you're here for. At least that's what you've been told. It's all that matters, anyway.

### Fodder

Fodder is there only to stall you and die without a name or a face. Fodder is destroyed with a successful attack action.

### Threat

Give them 1 tag. They have 1 HP.

Threats are strong fighters who were going to be just as special and unique as you are.

When you face a threat, choose whether you start at the end disadvantage or you spend 1 juice.

### Nemesis

Give them 3 tags. They have 5hp.

Your nemesis has a name and a face. You hate each other's guts, and maybe you used to be friends or lovers, or maybe you both just believe you've got the highest moral ground. The war doesn't care.

When you face your nemesis, decide whether this is a battle to the end.

If the answer is yes, highlight one more stat in this battle. If you win, you lose 1 module. If not you are destroyed.

If the answer is no, you start at a disadvantage unless you spend 1 juice. If you win, they will flee to die another day. If you lose, you are alive, but you lose 1 stat highlight. Leave the scene.

## Damage

Deal a defensive (1d6), balanced (2d6) or powerful (3d6) attack. You deal 1 damage per dice you roll above the target's challenge score. You lose 1 juice for every 1 you roll.

# 3. Defeat

At the end of the mission, if you survived, it doesn't matter. The war continues to try and kill you another time.

If you died, it doesn't matter. The war doesn't care about your sacrifice.
