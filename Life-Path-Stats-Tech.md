# Life Path Stats Tech

We will need a grid. Let's start with a 4x6 grid. I'm gonna use the examples for a game I got a concept for, which I currently call Warrior/Princess.

I thought of using this for a hack of Lasers and Feelings. By answering the prompts, we will figure out what is the Stat Number (or the numbers for multiple stats.

Mark how strongly each statement is true (2) or false (4) on the grid below.

Life Paths Fig. 1:
A 4x6 grid. Each column is numbered from 2-4. Besides each line of the grid on the right side, there is a sentence, specifically in this order:
"Your childhood was full of love and care.
You socialized aplenty as you grew.
You mastered subtlety and poise.
You easily learned to accept privilege.
You were taught how to compromise.
You were taught to plan and delegate."

I've come up with two ways to go about it.

a) mark an answer in the first row, then move down, and only to an adjacent roll.
Going left means that you strongly agree with that row's statement.
Going right means that you strongly disagree.
Staying in the middle means neither (or both). See the examples below:

LifePath Fig. 2:
Two examples of filling in the grid according to example a. In the first example, from top to bottom, each row is marked with an X on columns 5, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, respectively. The final number for the Warrior/Princess Stat is 4. In the second example, the rows are marked on columns 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, respectively. The final number is 2.

The last row determines your Stat number.

b) Assign a stat to each row. The stats you assign are somehow related to the prompt assigned to that row too.
Now just check your answer for each prompt, going from "strongly agree" (2) to "strongly disagree" (4).
Now each stat has its own number, which, in this hack, means an action or approach you must roll over or under, depending on whether you are doing it as a Warrior or Princess.

LifePath Fig. 3:
In the example, the rows are marked on columns 2,4,3,5,3,5, respectively. Each row is named according to a stat, and its number: Kindness 2, Etiquette 4, Influence 3, Command 5. Grit 3, Prowess 5.

You can also restrict answers to adjacent columns like in example a.
