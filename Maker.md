# Maker
You are a Maker. You make whenever something is amiss. You make whenever you wish to. You Make to make sense of the universe, and to unMake it all.

In order to play, you need a form of journaling: a diary, a scrapbook, loose, unbound pages (I find these the most interesting), or any other form to register your creation. This will be your Book of the Maker.

Every page of the Book of the Maker you fill is an Eon. It is a single instance of reality, of the all and the nothing. It is because you Made it and that's all that matters.

Every time you express your powers of Making, divide a page in three parts: The Past, The Now and The Future.

In the first part, you'll use the power of The Past, flawed and fallible. Memory cannot be trusted, as it is reshaped and repurposed every time you access it. And you are not your past, even though it has shaped you. What is that part of your past that no longer is? What is that past that you have changed? Now write it down and it is Made.

In the second part, you'll use the power of The Now, which has no judgment of The Past and it has no hope for The Future: it’s mindfulness. The Now simply is. Everything that comes to mind is The Now, be it a thought, an emotion, a feeling, a sensation. Now write it down, and it is Made.

In the third part, use the power of The Future, which is endless possibility. In order to Make The Future, you must realise that Something is wrong, but you must not allow yourself to walk down that road, as you risk losing yourself to anger and frutration. Imagine what if. Imagine what about. Imagine and go wild, for when you imagine you Make possible the impossible. Now write it down, and it is made.

INFORMATION

Maker is a game inspired by the article Write to the Future, by Georgina Escobar, and by the song Maker, by Anjimile. It is a solo journaling RPG about imagining impossible futures and Making them possible by imagining them, and it is part of my explorations of the Solarpunk fiction genre. I hope you enjoy it and that you Make possible any future you want.
