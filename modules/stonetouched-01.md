when the children of Lua come of age, they gather around the Stones. A set of semi-circular rocks that sprout from Fae, the ground.

Around the stones, they sing, and the stones hum in harmony with their chant.

The music is entrancing and few remember what happened to them during the ritual.

During the ritual, they touch one of the stones, and it transforms the youth into one of the forms of the moonfolk. A second stone offers a minor blessing.

The Black Stone grants the form of the Moon, Enluara.

The Myriad stone offers the Form of the Dream, Quimera.

The Coral Stone offers the form of 

The Nightstone offers the form of Star, the Celeste

The brimstone offers the Form of Fire

Usually, three to five youths participate in the ceremony together. 

Once they receive their blessings, they are to be sent out i the world, as a party, and must journey across the world to become wiser.
